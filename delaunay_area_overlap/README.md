## Measuring the overlap of Delaunay tessellations

* `view.py` to visualize select frames from the dataset
* `truncated_delaunay.py` creates a truncated Delaunay tessellation for a given frame
* `triangle_clip.py` shows an example of calculating the area overlap of two triangles
* `delaunay_area_overlap.py` calculates the area overlap of Delaunay tessellations
